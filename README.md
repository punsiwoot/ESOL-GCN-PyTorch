# ESOL DATASET with GCN
 this is my code when try to imprement and experiment machine learning on graph data structure ESOL dataset

## Train test split
 trainset : 80%
 validationset : 10%
 testset : 10%

## Experiment setup
Activation function : Tanh, Relu
Embedding size : 32, 64, 128
Number of layer : 2, 3, 4
Model Structure : Normal Layer, Pyramid Layer

Normal Layer : a message passing layer with the same size at any layer
Pyramid Layer : a message passing layer with the next layer will have a size devide by 2

From our experiment setup we have a combination of 2*3*3*2 = 36 model to experiment
*** on my training process i will stop when i found that the validation loss is start to increasing(overfitting)

## Summary result of Tunning 
-  Tanh Activation is more suit for capturing the relationship between the Node feature
-  using pyramid structure and normal structure will not affect the performance 
-  At embedding size of 32, 64 and 128 using more number of layer has improve model performance due to model is still underfit to dataset
-  At 128 size of embedding, Normal layer and Tanh Activation function(model 16) we found that the model perform better on 2 number of layer but at further more layer the model starting to overfitting 
- every MSE from testing set is far less than validation set so we consider that the model is overfitting to the testing data
- the model able to capture a relation in dataset but not enough for predict a solubility value

*** in the end Model 16 (best performance) is still have a MSE 0.558 or around 0.746 log(m/l) or around 5.571 mole per lite which is pretty large eror so this result still not good for deploy 

## From this experiment we found that 
For using GCN 
tanh activation function is more affective to this dataset
Using GCN with pyramid structure doesnâ€™t affect to model performance

For father experiment with GCN we suggest that :
	using tanh activation or activation that not cut off a negative value (leaky-relu)
	using more number of layer with multiple embedding size
	using more optimization technique (for example drop out layer)
